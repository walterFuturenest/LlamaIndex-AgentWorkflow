This is a [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) project using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) bootstrapped with [`create-llama`](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/packages/create-llama).

## Getting Started

First, setup the environment with poetry:

> **_Note:_** This step is not needed if you are using the dev-container.

```shell
poetry install
```

Then check the parameters that have been pre-configured in the `.env` file in this directory. (E.g. you might need to configure an `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you're using OpenAI as model provider).

Second, generate the embeddings of the documents in the `./data` directory (if this folder exists - otherwise, skip this step):

```shell
poetry run generate
```

Third, run all the agents in one command:

```shell
poetry run python main.py
```
